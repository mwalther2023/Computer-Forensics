With this system it can be determined the system has been compromised. 
Firstly a new user johnn was created and stored in a hidden folder and sucessfully logged in while the main user john was already logged in then prompted lightdm another user to log in as well right after. 
Lightdm being a user stored in bin/false is running a shell when it should not be able to while also being launched from the root as a process. 
Whoopsie also being a new user created in the bin/flase folder is shown as a running process with whoopsie being its UID.

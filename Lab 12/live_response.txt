Find shell listening on port 44965
Using netcat to find port reporting itself as SSH-2.0-WinSSHD
Through research discover this is a dropbear SSH backdoor and is possible to log-in through it
Multiple attempts to log-in through john via SSH. May 3 @ 23:07
Cannot be determined at this time whether these log-in attempts occured before or after the backdoor was installed
New user found named "mysqll" with home directory "/usr/local/mysql"
mysqll has userID 0 giving it root access

For project 2 I intend to focus on 
When the backdoor was installed to determine when the unsuccessful log-in attempts occured
When "mysqll" user was created
If "mysqll" executed any commands after its creation

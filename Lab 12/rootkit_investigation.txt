When accessing the bash_history the output shows that user john installed two additional rootkits to xingyi which are shown as Poison and RK.
Further investigating into the installation revealed that index2.php shows the successful installation of Poison.
Through the bash_history we are also able to see a ./install.sh command executed while in the rk directory meaning this rootkit was also successfully installed as well.

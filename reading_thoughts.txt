With the system being compromised actively setting up a new system to replace the old and compromised one is a good decision instead of attempting to salvage the old equipment.
Before pulling the plug copying the information from the compromised system is the best way to be able to analyze the data. This further secures the data being in a seperate system from getting altered by the original infiltrator.
initial-scan.sh provides the initial conlcusion that the system is compromised and allows us to further investigate to determine how and when it occurred.
Having an SSH backdoor is a concern for remote infiltration to crack a user password.
Utilizing MySQL to obtain a list of log-in fails and successes is an interesting way to determine what user was active or attempting to log-in during the time of rootkit downloads.
This whole process while it seems complex seems to quickly piece together the situation of how the system became compromised.
